# 3D ASCII Rotating Donut with Self-Code Display Architecture Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for **3D ASCII Rotating Donut with Self-Code Display**, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
This project is entirely terminal-based with no traditional UI components. The "frontend" is the ASCII terminal display, which is integrated directly into the core application architecture rather than requiring a separate frontend architecture document.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on your PRD requirements for a single Python file with zero external dependencies, this is a **greenfield project built from scratch**. No starter template will be used to maintain maximum simplicity and educational value.

**Rationale:** Using a starter template would introduce unnecessary complexity and dependencies that conflict with the core requirement of being a single, self-contained Python file. The educational and viral sharing goals are best served by a clean, from-scratch implementation that showcases pure Python capabilities.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Single Python file structure for maximum shareability
- Pure Python standard library only (no external dependencies)
- Self-contained architecture with no external services
- Cross-platform terminal compatibility as primary constraint

## High Level Architecture

### Technical Summary

The system implements a **monolithic, self-contained architecture** using pure Python with real-time mathematical computation, token-based parsing, and ASCII rendering. The core design centers around a continuous animation loop that performs 3D torus geometry calculations, self-referential source code analysis, and terminal-based visualization. Key components include the mathematical engine (parametric torus equations), the parsing engine (Python tokenization), the rendering engine (ASCII projection), and the animation controller (frame timing and rotation). This architecture directly supports the PRD goals of creating viral, educational content by maintaining simplicity, immediate execution, and cross-platform compatibility.

### High Level Overview

**Architectural Style:** Monolithic single-file application with real-time processing
**Repository Structure:** Single repository, single Python file (as specified in PRD)
**Service Architecture:** Monolith - all functionality contained within one executable script

**Primary Data Flow:**
1. **Initialization:** Script reads its own source code and parses tokens
2. **Preprocessing:** Tokens are classified and mapped to surface coordinates
3. **Animation Loop:** Continuous cycle of 3D rotation → projection → ASCII rendering → display
4. **Self-Reference:** The very code being executed drives its own visual representation

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- **Single-file constraint** enables viral sharing and educational inspection
- **Zero external dependencies** ensures universal Python compatibility
- **Real-time processing** creates immediate visual impact without build steps
- **Self-referential design** creates unique artistic and technical showcase

### Architectural and Design Patterns

**Core Architectural Patterns:**

- **Self-Referential Architecture:** The application analyzes and visualizes its own source code structure - _Rationale:_ Creates unique artistic concept and educational value while ensuring the visualization always reflects the current implementation

- **Real-Time Processing Pipeline:** Continuous data flow from mathematical computation through rendering to display - _Rationale:_ Supports the animation requirement and immediate visual impact needed for viral content

- **Functional Decomposition:** Clear separation between mathematical, parsing, and rendering concerns within single file - _Rationale:_ Maintains code clarity and educational value while respecting the single-file constraint

- **Stateless Frame Generation:** Each animation frame is computed independently from 3D coordinates - _Rationale:_ Simplifies animation logic and ensures consistent visual quality across all rotation angles

- **Token-Driven Rendering:** Visual output directly determined by source code semantic analysis - _Rationale:_ Creates the core innovative feature that transforms code structure into mathematical art

## External APIs

**External APIs: None Required**

This project intentionally avoids all external API integrations to maintain:
- Maximum portability and viral shareability
- Zero-dependency execution
- Educational transparency
- Cross-platform compatibility

The self-referential nature means the "data source" is the script's own code, eliminating any need for external services, APIs, or network connectivity.

## REST API Spec

**REST API: Not Applicable**

This project does not include any REST API functionality. The application operates entirely through:
- Direct Python script execution
- Terminal-based ASCII output
- Self-contained operation with no network services

The viral sharing and educational goals are achieved through code sharing rather than API endpoints.

## Database Schema

**Database: Not Applicable**

This project operates entirely in-memory with no persistent data storage requirements. The self-referential design means:

- **Source Code** serves as the "database" - the script reads its own source for token data
- **All state is transient** - each animation frame is computed fresh from mathematical functions
- **No data persistence needed** - the artistic visualization is ephemeral and continuous
- **Zero external dependencies** - no database drivers, files, or storage systems

**Data Flow Architecture:**
```
Source Code (Static) → Tokens (Parsed Once) → 3D Points (Computed Per Frame) → ASCII Display (Ephemeral)
```

The architectural decision to avoid databases aligns perfectly with the viral sharing goals - users can run the script immediately without any setup, configuration, or data initialization steps.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Tool:** Not applicable
- **Location:** Not applicable
- **Approach:** No infrastructure required - direct Python execution on user machines

### Deployment Strategy
- **Strategy:** Direct script sharing and execution
- **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions (for testing and release automation)
- **Pipeline Configuration:** `.github/workflows/test.yml` for automated testing across Python versions

### Environments

- **Development:** Local Python 3.8+ with testing framework
- **Testing:** GitHub Actions matrix testing (Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11) across (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
- **Production:** End-user local execution - no server infrastructure required
- **Sharing:** Git repository hosting (GitHub) with releases for version management

### Environment Promotion Flow

```
Developer Machine → Git Commit → GitHub Repository → Automated Testing → Release Tag → User Download/Clone → Direct Execution
```

**Distribution Channels:**
1. **GitHub Repository** - Primary distribution with README, documentation, and releases
2. **Social Media Sharing** - Direct file sharing for immediate execution
3. **Educational Platforms** - Integration into coding tutorials and mathematical visualization courses
4. **Community Forums** - Reddit, Stack Overflow, creative coding communities

### Rollback Strategy
- **Primary Method:** Git version control with tagged releases
- **Trigger Conditions:** Critical bugs affecting cross-platform compatibility or mathematical accuracy
- **Recovery Time Objective:** Immediate (users can revert to previous working version instantly)

## Error Handling Strategy

### General Approach
- **Error Model:** Exception-based with graceful degradation for non-critical failures
- **Exception Hierarchy:** Built-in Python exceptions with custom error messages for user clarity
- **Error Propagation:** Fail fast for critical errors, graceful fallback for visual/performance issues

### Logging Standards
- **Library:** Built-in logging module (Python stdlib)
- **Format:** Simple timestamp + level + message (no complex structured logging needed)
- **Levels:** ERROR (critical failures), WARNING (degraded performance), INFO (startup messages)
- **Required Context:**
  - Correlation ID: Frame number for animation-related errors
  - Service Context: Component name (MathEngine, Parser, Renderer, Controller)
  - User Context: No user identification needed (single-user application)

### Error Handling Patterns

#### External API Errors
**Not Applicable** - This project has no external API dependencies by design

#### Business Logic Errors
- **Custom Exceptions:** `MathematicalError`, `TokenizationError`, `RenderingError`
- **User-Facing Errors:** Clear, actionable error messages in plain English
- **Error Codes:** Simple numeric codes for documentation reference

#### Data Consistency
- **Transaction Strategy:** Not applicable (no persistent data)
- **Compensation Logic:** Regenerate frame data on mathematical errors
- **Idempotency:** Each frame generation is stateless and can be safely retried

## Coding Standards

**IMPORTANT:** These standards are MANDATORY for AI agents developing this project. They focus on project-specific conventions and potential pitfalls rather than general best practices.

### Core Standards
- **Languages & Runtimes:** Python 3.8+ only, no version compatibility shims
- **Style & Linting:** PEP 8 compliance with 88-character line length (Black formatter style)
- **Test Organization:** Tests in separate files, mathematical accuracy tests required for all geometry functions

### Naming Conventions

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Functions | snake_case with descriptive math terms | `generate_torus_points()`, `apply_rotation_matrix()` |
| Constants | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for mathematical constants | `TORUS_OUTER_RADIUS`, `FRAME_RATE_TARGET` |
| Classes/NamedTuples | PascalCase for data models | `Point3D`, `CodeToken`, `TorusParameters` |

### Critical Rules

- **Mathematical Precision:** Always use `math.pi` and `math.tau`, never hardcoded decimal approximations
- **Performance Critical:** Cache torus geometry calculations - never regenerate identical point sets
- **Self-Reference Safety:** Validate `__file__` exists before attempting self-code reading
- **Terminal Compatibility:** Use `print(..., flush=True)` for all animation output to prevent buffering issues
- **Error Message Format:** All user-facing errors must include "Solution:" with actionable guidance
- **Frame Rate Enforcement:** Every animation loop iteration must include timing control - never run unbounded
- **Memory Management:** Clear display buffers after each frame - prevent memory accumulation during long runs
- **Mathematical Validation:** All torus parameters must be validated (outer_radius > inner_radius > 0)
- **Token Classification:** Unknown token types must default to LOW importance, never fail parsing
- **ASCII Character Safety:** Only use characters guaranteed available in basic terminal: . - + # (no Unicode)

### Language-Specific Guidelines

#### Python Specifics
- **Type Hints:** Use for all function signatures involving mathematical calculations
- **f-strings:** Required for all string formatting (leverages Python 3.8+ requirement)
- **Math Module Usage:** Import specific functions (`from math import sin, cos, pi`) for performance
- **List Comprehensions:** Prefer for point generation and transformations when readable
- **Exception Handling:** Catch specific exceptions, never bare `except:` clauses
- **Main Guard:** Always use `if __name__ == "__main__":` pattern for executable scripts

## Test Strategy and Standards

### Testing Philosophy
- **Approach:** Test-after development with mathematical accuracy validation and visual output verification
- **Coverage Goals:** 90%+ for mathematical functions, 70%+ for rendering logic, 100% for critical path (animation loop)
- **Test Pyramid:** 70% unit tests (math/parsing), 20% integration tests (component interaction), 10% visual validation tests

### Test Types and Organization

#### Unit Tests
- **Framework:** pytest 7.4+ with built-in fixtures
- **File Convention:** `test_{component_name}.py` (e.g., `test_mathematical.py`, `test_parsing.py`)
- **Location:** `tests/` directory separate from main script
- **Mocking Library:** unittest.mock (Python stdlib) for file I/O and terminal output
- **Coverage Requirement:** 90%+ for all mathematical calculations

**AI Agent Requirements:**
- Generate tests for all public mathematical functions with known geometric properties
- Cover edge cases: zero radius, negative values, extreme rotation angles, empty token lists
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) with clear test names
- Mock file system operations and terminal output for deterministic testing
- Validate mathematical properties: torus volume, surface area, point distribution

#### Integration Tests
- **Scope:** Component interaction, end-to-end animation pipeline, cross-platform compatibility
- **Location:** `tests/test_integration.py`
- **Test Infrastructure:**
  - **Terminal Output:** Capture stdout for visual validation
  - **File System:** Temporary test files for self-reading scenarios
  - **Performance:** Frame rate measurement and timing validation

#### Visual Validation Tests
- **Framework:** Custom visual comparison utilities
- **Scope:** ASCII output correctness, rotation continuity, visual quality
- **Environment:** Controlled test environment with known source code
- **Test Data:** Predefined token sets and expected visual patterns

### Test Data Management
- **Strategy:** Generated test data using mathematical properties and controlled source code samples
- **Fixtures:** `pytest` fixtures for torus parameters, token samples, and expected results
- **Factories:** Helper functions to generate test cases with various complexity levels
- **Cleanup:** Automatic cleanup of temporary files and terminal state restoration

### Continuous Testing
- **CI Integration:** GitHub Actions matrix testing across Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 on Ubuntu, Windows, macOS
- **Performance Tests:** Automated frame rate validation and memory usage monitoring
- **Security Tests:** Static analysis for potential code injection through self-reading mechanisms

## Security

### Input Validation
- **Validation Library:** Built-in Python validation (no external dependencies)
- **Validation Location:** At mathematical function entry points and file reading operations
- **Required Rules:**
