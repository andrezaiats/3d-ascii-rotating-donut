nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security vulnerabilities identified. Modular refactoring maintains security posture with proper separation of concerns.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'All performance targets achieved and maintained after refactoring: 30+ FPS, <20ms math operations, >90% cache hit rates. No performance degradation from modularization.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling, memory leak detection, and performance monitoring systems. All functionality preserved after modular refactoring.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent improvement - rotating_donut.py reduced from 5,346 to 3,939 lines (-26.3%). Professional modular architecture with cache_manager.py (216 lines) and performance_monitor.py (112 lines).'
