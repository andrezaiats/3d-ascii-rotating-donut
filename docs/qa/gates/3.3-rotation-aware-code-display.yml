# Quality Gate Decision for Story 3.3: Rotation-Aware Code Display

schema: 1
story: "3.3"
story_title: "Rotation-Aware Code Display"
gate: "PASS"
status_reason: "Critical performance and rendering issues identified and resolved - implementation now meets all requirements"
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
updated: "2025-09-27T00:00:00Z"

waiver: { active: false }

top_issues:
  - id: "PERF-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Performance regression from 80+ FPS to 30 FPS due to expensive per-frame surface normal rotations"
    suggested_action: "Fixed during review - eliminated surface normal rotation calculations to restore 80+ FPS performance"
  - id: "VIS-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Incorrect dot rendering making 3D donut model hard to understand due to overly complex visibility system"
    suggested_action: "Fixed during review - simplified dimming logic to preserve front-facing surface characters"
