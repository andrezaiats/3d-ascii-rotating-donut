## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 completion: Complete mathematical engine with `generate_torus_points()` function working perfectly. Point3D model established with x, y, z coordinates and u, v parametric values. Mathematical precision patterns and caching performance optimizations are in place. All torus generation is ready for projection processing.

### Data Models
Key data models for this story [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:
- **Point3D**: x, y, z coordinates with u, v parametric values - already implemented from story 1.2
- **Point2D**: x (int 0-39), y (int 0-19), depth (float), visible (bool) - screen coordinates for ASCII terminal display
- **DisplayFrame**: width=40, height=20, buffer and depth_buffer arrays - target for projected coordinates

### Component Specifications
From MathematicalEngine component [Source: architecture/components.md#mathematicalengine]:
- **Core Interface**: `project_to_screen(point: Point3D) -> Point2D` - perspective projection to 2D coordinates
- **Technology**: Pure Python with math module for projection calculations
- **Dependencies**: Point3D and Point2D data models, math module for perspective formulas

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- **Implementation Location**: `rotating_donut.py` in project root under "=== MATHEMATICAL ENGINE ===" section
- **Function Placement**: After existing `generate_torus_points()` and rotation functions
- **Import Requirements**: Already established math module imports from story 1.2

### Technical Constraints
From coding standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- **Mathematical Precision**: Use `math.pi` and specific math function imports for performance
- **Type Hints**: Required for all mathematical function signatures
- **Error Format**: Include "Solution:" with actionable guidance for projection errors
- **Performance Critical**: Optimize projection calculations for smooth 30+ FPS animation
- **Mathematical Validation**: Validate camera distance > 0, handle edge cases gracefully

### Projection Mathematics
Perspective projection equations to implement:
```
screen_x = (3D_x * focal_length) / (3D_z + camera_distance)
screen_y = (3D_y * focal_length) / (3D_z + camera_distance)
```
Coordinate mapping to 40x20 grid:
```
grid_x = int((screen_x + 1.0) * 20)  # Map [-1,1] to [0,39]
grid_y = int((screen_y + 1.0) * 10)  # Map [-1,1] to [0,19]
```

### Display Frame Integration
Point2D coordinates feed into DisplayFrame [Source: architecture/data-models.md#displayframe]:
- **Buffer mapping**: Point2D.x/y map to DisplayFrame.buffer[y][x] positions
- **Depth sorting**: Point2D.depth feeds DisplayFrame.depth_buffer for proper layering
- **Visibility**: Point2D.visible determines whether point contributes to frame

### Testing
**Test Location**: `tests/test_mathematical.py` [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
**Framework**: pytest 7.4+ with built-in fixtures [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
**Coverage Requirement**: 90%+ for mathematical functions [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#testing-philosophy]
**Test Requirements**: Validate projection accuracy with known coordinates, test edge cases (points behind camera, extreme values), verify grid mapping correctness, validate depth calculation precision [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
**Mocking**: unittest.mock for mathematical edge case scenarios [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]

### Project Structure Notes
Implementation aligns perfectly with existing architecture. The `rotating_donut.py` file already has MathematicalEngine section with `generate_torus_points()` complete. The `project_to_screen()` function will be added in the same section following established patterns.
