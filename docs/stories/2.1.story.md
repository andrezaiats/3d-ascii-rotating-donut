# Story 2.1: Self-File Reading System

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** the script to read its own source code reliably,
**so that** it can analyze and visualize its own structure.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Use `__file__` to identify the script's own path reliably across platforms
2. Read complete source code content with proper encoding handling (UTF-8)
3. Handle edge cases like symbolic links, relative paths, and different file systems
4. Validate that file content matches current executing code
5. Gracefully handle file access errors with informative messages

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Implement reliable path identification using `__file__` (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create `get_script_path()` function in PARSING ENGINE section
  - [x] Handle absolute path resolution using `os.path.abspath(__file__)`
  - [x] Add cross-platform path normalization with `os.path.normpath()`
  - [x] Include validation that `__file__` exists and is accessible

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Epic 1 completion: Complete 3D torus mathematical foundation, projection system, ASCII rendering engine, and animation loop are all working perfectly. The ParsingEngine section exists in `rotating_donut.py` with placeholder functions ready for self-referential code analysis implementation. Animation system provides smooth 30+ FPS performance with graceful keyboard interrupt handling.

### Data Models
Key data models for this story [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:
- **CodeToken**: type, value, importance, line, column, ascii_char - target structure for parsed source content
- **No specific data models needed for file reading**: This story focuses on raw string content acquisition before tokenization

### Component Specifications
From ParsingEngine component [Source: architecture/components.md#parsingengine]:
- **Core Interfaces**:
  - `read_self_code() -> str` - Uses `__file__` to read own source code with UTF-8 encoding
  - Must integrate with future `tokenize_code(source: str) -> List[CodeToken]` function
- **Technology**: Python file I/O operations, built-in __file__ variable, os.path utilities
- **Dependencies**: File system access, UTF-8 encoding support, cross-platform path handling

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- **Implementation Location**: `rotating_donut.py` in project root under "=== PARSING ENGINE ===" section
- **Function Placement**: Before tokenize_code() and classify_importance() functions
- **Integration Point**: Coordinates with existing animation loop and future tokenization system

### Technology Stack
From tech stack [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **File Access**: __file__ + open() (stdlib) for script self-inspection
- **Path Handling**: os.path (stdlib) for cross-platform path resolution
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 encoding specification for source code reading
- **Error Handling**: Built-in exceptions (stdlib) for graceful failure modes

### Technical Constraints
From coding standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- **Self-Reference Safety**: Validate `__file__` exists before attempting self-code reading
- **Error Message Format**: All user-facing errors must include "Solution:" with actionable guidance
- **UTF-8 Encoding**: Always specify encoding explicitly when reading text files
- **Cross-Platform**: Use os.path utilities for platform-independent file operations
- **File Validation**: Check file exists and is readable before processing

### Core Workflow Integration
Based on application startup workflow [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#application-startup-and-initialization]:
- Self-file reading is the first step in ParsingEngine initialization
- Raw source content feeds into tokenize module for semantic analysis
- Error handling must gracefully exit with informative messages for file access failures
- Integration with existing script initialization and main() function structure

### Error Handling Strategy
From error handling patterns [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]:
- **FileNotFoundError**: Clear error message with file path and suggested solutions
- **PermissionError**: Actionable guidance for file permission issues
- **UnicodeDecodeError**: Fallback options and encoding troubleshooting steps
- **Business Logic Errors**: Use simple numeric error codes for documentation reference

### Project Structure Notes
Implementation aligns perfectly with existing architecture. The `rotating_donut.py` file already has "=== PARSING ENGINE ===" section with placeholder for `read_self_code()` function. Self-file reading will provide the foundation for the complete self-referential token processing workflow defined in Epic 2.

### Testing
**Test Location**: `tests/test_parsing.py` [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
**Framework**: pytest 7.4+ with unittest.mock for file I/O operations [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
**Coverage Requirement**: 90%+ for all file reading functions [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#testing-philosophy]
**Test Requirements**: Cross-platform path handling, encoding validation, edge case coverage, error message verification [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
**Mocking**: unittest.mock for file system operations and __file__ scenarios [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
