# Story 2.3: Semantic Importance Hierarchy

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a 4-level importance ranking system for code tokens,
**so that** visually significant elements can be emphasized in the donut display.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Define 4-level brightness hierarchy: Critical (keywords), High (operators), Medium (identifiers), Low (comments/whitespace)
2. Map Python token types to appropriate importance levels based on semantic value
3. Create configurable importance weights for fine-tuning visual emphasis
4. Handle special cases like built-in functions, decorators, and string literals
5. Document importance classification rationale in code comments

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.2 completion: Successfully implemented `tokenize_code()` function with comprehensive token classification. The function correctly maps Python's tokenize module types to the project's token classification system with position tracking. Token type mapping established: KEYWORD (HIGH), OPERATOR/IDENTIFIER/LITERAL (MEDIUM), COMMENT/WHITESPACE/SPECIAL (LOW). The PARSING ENGINE section in `rotating_donut.py` (lines 626-740) is ready with imports (`ast`, `os`, `keyword`) and provides perfect foundation for importance classification.

### Data Models
Key data models for this story [Source: architecture/data-models.md#codetoken]:
- **CodeToken**: type, value, importance, line, column, ascii_char - target structure for importance assignment
  - type: TokenType - Classification (KEYWORD, OPERATOR, IDENTIFIER, LITERAL, COMMENT)
  - value: str - Actual token text content for special case detection
  - importance: ImportanceLevel - Semantic weight (CRITICAL=4, HIGH=3, MEDIUM=2, LOW=1)
  - line: int - Source line number for debugging
  - column: int - Source column position for debugging
  - ascii_char: str - Associated ASCII character for rendering

### Component Specifications
From ParsingEngine component [Source: architecture/components.md#parsingengine]:
- **Core Interface**: `classify_importance(token: CodeToken) -> ImportanceLevel` - Assigns semantic importance hierarchy
- **Technology**: Built-in Python keyword detection, semantic analysis based on token types
- **Dependencies**: CodeToken data model, keyword module for built-in detection
- **Integration**: Receives tokens from `tokenize_code()` and feeds into future token-to-surface mapping

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- **Implementation Location**: `rotating_donut.py` in project root under "=== PARSING ENGINE ===" section
- **Function Placement**: After `tokenize_code()` function (around line 741), before token-to-surface mapping functions
- **Integration Point**: Coordinates with existing tokenization and future rendering pipeline

### Technology Stack
From tech stack [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#parsing]:
- **Semantic Analysis**: Built-in Python keyword module, tokenize module constants for classification
- **Data Processing**: Built-in Python data structures for importance mapping
- **Error Handling**: Built-in exceptions (stdlib) for graceful failure modes
- **Performance**: Pure stdlib implementation, no external dependencies

### Technical Constraints
From coding standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- **Token Classification Safety**: Unknown token types must default to LOW importance, never fail parsing
- **Error Message Format**: All user-facing errors must include "Solution:" with actionable guidance
- **Performance**: No external dependencies, pure stdlib implementation required
- **Type Hints**: Use for all function signatures involving importance processing
- **Exception Handling**: Catch specific exceptions, never bare `except:` clauses

### Core Workflow Integration
Based on self-referential token processing workflow [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#self-referential-token-processing]:
- classify_importance() receives classified tokens from tokenize_code()
- Processes tokens through semantic importance hierarchy assignment
- Maps token types to importance levels: KEYWORD→CRITICAL, OPERATOR→HIGH, IDENTIFIER→MEDIUM, COMMENT/WHITESPACE→LOW
- Feeds importance-ranked tokens into future token-to-surface mapping for visual representation
- Integration with animation loop for dynamic code-driven rendering

### Error Handling Strategy
From error handling patterns [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#business-logic-errors]:
- **Custom Exceptions**: TokenizationError for classification failures with clear error messages
- **Input Validation**: Handle malformed CodeToken objects gracefully
- **Recovery Strategy**: Default to LOW importance for unknown token types
- **Error Codes**: Simple numeric codes for documentation reference

### Project Structure Notes
Implementation aligns perfectly with existing architecture. The `rotating_donut.py` file has the PARSING ENGINE section ready for `classify_importance()` function implementation. This story builds directly on Story 2.2's tokenization foundation and prepares for Story 2.4's token-to-ASCII character mapping system.

### Testing
**Test Location**: `tests/test_parsing.py` [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
**Framework**: pytest 7.4+ with unittest.mock for edge case testing [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
**Coverage Requirement**: 90%+ for all parsing functions [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#testing-philosophy]
**Test Requirements**: Importance level classification accuracy, special case handling verification, configurable weight functionality, error handling validation [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
**Integration**: Coordinate with existing tokenization tests, validate end-to-end parsing pipeline [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation quality with clean 4-level importance hierarchy design. The `classify_importance()` function demonstrates solid architecture with comprehensive error handling, robust special case detection (built-ins, decorators, string literals), and proper integration with the existing tokenization system. Code follows all established patterns and maintains consistency with project conventions.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: rotating_donut.py
  - **Change**: Removed redundant string literal classification check at lines 840-841
  - **Why**: The string literal check was already covered by the LITERAL token type classification above it
  - **How**: Simplified code path improves maintainability without changing functionality

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Full compliance with Python 3.8+ requirements, proper type hints, "Solution:" error format, and ASCII character safety
- Project Structure: ✓ Correctly implemented in PARSING ENGINE section with proper integration
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Exceeds 90% coverage requirement with 62 comprehensive tests (100% pass rate)
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated through testing

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Optimized classify_importance() function by removing redundant code path (rotating_donut.py:835-837)
- [x] Verified all test coverage remains at 100% after refactoring
- [ ] Consider adding performance benchmarks for large code files (future enhancement)
- [ ] Consider adding import alias detection for built-in functions (future enhancement)

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Input validation prevents malformed token processing, and safe fallback handling ensures unknown token types are processed safely.

### Performance Considerations

Excellent performance characteristics with O(1) classification logic per token, pure stdlib implementation (no external dependencies), and efficient cached importance weights. Test execution time of 0.060s for 62 tests demonstrates optimized implementation.
