# Story 2.4: Token-to-ASCII Character Mapping

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** tokens mapped to specific ASCII characters based on importance,
**so that** code structure drives visual representation on the torus surface.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Implement density mapping where important tokens occupy more surface points
3. Distribute tokens across torus surface based on token sequence and importance
4. Handle varying source code lengths by scaling distribution appropriately

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.3 completion: Successfully implemented 4-level semantic importance hierarchy with ImportanceLevel enum (CRITICAL=4, HIGH=3, MEDIUM=2, LOW=1) and classify_importance() function. ASCII character mapping already established: CRITICAL→'#', HIGH→'+', MEDIUM→'-', LOW→'.'. The parsing system now produces fully classified tokens ready for surface mapping. Integration point established between tokenization and future rendering pipeline.

### Data Models
Key data models for this story [Source: architecture/data-models.md#codetoken]:
- **CodeToken**: type, value, importance, line, column, ascii_char - input for surface mapping
  - ascii_char: str - Already set by importance classification (# + - .)
  - importance: ImportanceLevel - Drives density allocation (4=CRITICAL, 3=HIGH, 2=MEDIUM, 1=LOW)
- **Point3D**: x, y, z, u, v - target surface coordinates for token placement
  - u: float - Parametric u coordinate on torus surface (0-2π) for sequence distribution
  - v: float - Parametric v coordinate on torus surface (0-2π) for visual balance
- **DisplayFrame**: width, height, buffer, depth_buffer - final output structure
  - buffer: List[List[str]] - 2D array populated with token ascii_char values

### Component Specifications
From RenderingEngine component [Source: architecture/components.md#renderingengine]:
- **Core Interface**: `map_tokens_to_surface(tokens: List[CodeToken], points: List[Point3D]) -> None` - Distributes tokens across torus
- **Technology**: Pure Python with built-in sorting algorithms for importance-based distribution
- **Dependencies**: CodeToken and Point3D models, mathematical distribution algorithms
- **Integration**: Receives classified tokens from ParsingEngine and 3D points from MathematicalEngine

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- **Implementation Location**: `rotating_donut.py` in project root under "=== RENDERING ENGINE ===" section
- **Function Placement**: After mathematical engine functions, coordinates with existing rendering pipeline
- **Integration Point**: Links ParsingEngine token output with MathematicalEngine point generation

### Technology Stack
From tech stack [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#rendering]:
- **Distribution Algorithm**: Pure Python with built-in data structures for token-to-point mapping
- **Performance**: Built-in sorting and distribution, no external dependencies required
- **Error Handling**: Built-in exceptions (stdlib) for graceful failure modes
- **Memory Management**: Efficient point assignment without duplication

### Technical Constraints
From coding standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- **ASCII Character Safety**: Only use characters guaranteed available in basic terminal: . - + # (no Unicode)
- **Performance Critical**: Cache token-to-surface mapping calculations when possible
- **Error Message Format**: All user-facing errors must include "Solution:" with actionable guidance
- **Mathematical Validation**: Ensure distribution covers entire torus surface without gaps
- **Memory Management**: Clear surface assignments after each frame to prevent accumulation

### Core Workflow Integration
Based on self-referential token processing workflow [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#self-referential-token-processing]:
- map_tokens_to_surface() receives classified tokens from classify_importance()
- Maps tokens to 3D surface coordinates from generate_torus_points()
- Assigns ASCII characters based on importance hierarchy: CRITICAL='#', HIGH='+', MEDIUM='-', LOW='.'
- Feeds token-mapped surface points into generate_ascii_frame() for final rendering
- Supports continuous animation with dynamic token redistribution per frame

### Error Handling Strategy
From error handling patterns [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#business-logic-errors]:
- **Custom Exceptions**: RenderingError for surface mapping failures with clear error messages
- **Input Validation**: Handle empty token lists, insufficient surface points gracefully
- **Recovery Strategy**: Default to even distribution when density mapping fails
- **Error Codes**: Simple numeric codes for documentation reference

### Project Structure Notes
Implementation aligns perfectly with existing architecture. The `rotating_donut.py` file has the RENDERING ENGINE section ready for `map_tokens_to_surface()` function implementation. This story builds directly on Story 2.3's importance classification and prepares for complete visual rendering pipeline integration.

### Testing
**Test Location**: `tests/test_rendering.py` [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
**Framework**: pytest 7.4+ with unittest.mock for component interaction testing [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
**Coverage Requirement**: 90%+ for all rendering functions [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#testing-philosophy]
**Test Requirements**: Token distribution accuracy, density mapping validation, scaling behavior verification, visual balance assessment [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
**Integration**: Coordinate with existing parsing and mathematical engine tests [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
