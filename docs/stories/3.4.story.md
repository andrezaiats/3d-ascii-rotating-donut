## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.3 completion: Successfully implemented rotation-aware visibility with optimized surface normal calculations, achieving 80+ FPS performance after eliminating expensive per-frame surface normal rotations. The token-driven character assignment with importance hierarchy (CRITICAL=#, HIGH=+, MEDIUM=-, LOW=.) is working well with sophisticated visibility determination. Cache optimizations have already been implemented for visibility calculations. The foundation exists for seamless integration; focus needed on pipeline optimization and token caching to eliminate remaining parsing bottlenecks in the animation loop.

### Data Models
Key data models for this story [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:
- **CodeToken**: type, value, importance, line, column, ascii_char - Needs efficient caching structure for fast frame-to-frame access
  - TokenCache data structure required for storing preprocessed token classifications and mappings
  - Cached importance levels avoid repeated classification overhead during animation
- **Point3D**: x, y, z, u, v, nx, ny, nz - Enhanced Point3D from Story 3.3 provides foundation for cached token-to-surface mapping
  - Cached token mappings use parametric (u,v) coordinates for consistent distribution across rotations
  - Surface normal data enables rotation-aware character assignment optimization
- **DisplayFrame**: width, height, buffer, depth_buffer, frame_number - Requires memory management optimization for long-running animations
  - Buffer lifecycle management prevents memory accumulation during extended sessions
  - Frame numbering supports performance tracking and debugging
- **TorusParameters**: outer_radius, inner_radius, u_resolution, v_resolution, rotation_speed - Parameters drive cache sizing and performance optimization
  - Resolution parameters determine cache requirements for token distribution
  - Rotation speed affects frame timing and performance optimization strategies
