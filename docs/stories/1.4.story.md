## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3 completion: Complete 3D projection system with `project_to_screen()` function working perfectly. Point2D model established with x (0-39), y (0-19), depth (float), visible (bool) coordinates. All projected points ready for rendering with proper depth values for Z-sorting. Grid mapping verified: screen coordinates correctly map to 40x20 ASCII terminal grid.

### Data Models
Key data models for this story [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:
- **DisplayFrame**: width=40, height=20, buffer (2D string array), depth_buffer (2D float array), frame_number (int) - main rendering target
- **Point2D**: x (int 0-39), y (int 0-19), depth (float), visible (bool) - input from projection system
- **CodeToken**: ascii_char (str) - character assignment for surface rendering (future integration)

### Component Specifications
From RenderingEngine component [Source: architecture/components.md#renderingengine]:
- **Core Interfaces**:
  - `generate_ascii_frame(points: List[Point2D]) -> DisplayFrame` - creates character buffer with depth sorting
  - `output_to_terminal(frame: DisplayFrame) -> None` - renders frame to stdout with screen clearing
- **Technology**: Pure Python with sys.stdout, built-in sorting for depth management, print() with flush
- **Dependencies**: Point2D model, DisplayFrame buffer management, sys.stdout for terminal output

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- **Implementation Location**: `rotating_donut.py` in project root under "=== RENDERING ENGINE ===" section
- **Function Placement**: After Mathematical Engine and before Animation Controller sections
- **Import Requirements**: sys.stdout already available, no additional imports needed

### Technical Constraints
From coding standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- **Terminal Compatibility**: Use `print(..., flush=True)` for all animation output to prevent buffering
- **ASCII Character Safety**: Only use characters guaranteed in basic terminal: . - + # (no Unicode)
- **Frame Rate Enforcement**: Include timing control for smooth 30+ FPS animation
- **Memory Management**: Clear display buffers after each frame to prevent memory accumulation
- **Error Message Format**: All errors must include "Solution:" with actionable guidance

### Depth Sorting Algorithm
Painter's algorithm implementation:
```
1. Sort Point2D list by depth value (farthest to closest)
2. Render points in sorted order to DisplayFrame buffer
3. For each position, update depth_buffer if current point is closer
4. Overwrite buffer position only if depth check passes
```

### Character Mapping Strategy
Depth-based ASCII character assignment:
```
depth >= 0.75: '.' (background/far)
depth >= 0.5:  '-' (medium-far)
depth >= 0.25: '+' (medium-close)
depth < 0.25:  '#' (closest/foreground)
```

### Terminal Output Requirements
Cross-platform screen clearing [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- **ANSI Clear**: `print("\033[2J\033[H", end="", flush=True)` for Unix/Linux/macOS
- **Windows Compatibility**: Same ANSI codes work in modern Windows Terminal
- **Frame Output**: Each frame printed line-by-line with final flush for smoothness

### Testing
**Test Location**: `tests/test_rendering.py` [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
**Framework**: pytest 7.4+ with built-in fixtures [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
**Coverage Requirement**: 70%+ for rendering logic [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#testing-philosophy]
**Test Requirements**: Validate buffer creation/clearing, depth sorting accuracy, character mapping correctness, terminal output capture [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
**Mocking**: unittest.mock for sys.stdout and terminal operations [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]

### Project Structure Notes
Implementation aligns with existing architecture. The `rotating_donut.py` file structure shows clear "=== RENDERING ENGINE ===" section placement. Functions will integrate with existing Point2D data from Mathematical Engine projection system.
