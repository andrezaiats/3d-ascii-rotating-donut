## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.4 completion: Successfully implemented map_tokens_to_surface() function with comprehensive token-to-surface mapping including density allocation, scaling, and visual balance. Established 4-level importance hierarchy (CRITICAL=#, HIGH=+, MEDIUM=-, LOW=.) and token classification system. The rendering pipeline is ready for enhanced structural analysis to influence visual representation based on code architecture patterns.

### Data Models
Key data models for this story [Source: architecture/data-models.md#codetoken]:
- **CodeToken**: type, value, importance, line, column, ascii_char - enhanced with structural context
  - importance: ImportanceLevel - Will be modified by structural analysis
  - type: TokenType - Used for structural element identification (KEYWORD, IDENTIFIER, etc.)
  - line/column: int - Essential for structural boundary detection and nesting depth
- **Point3D**: x, y, z, u, v - target coordinates influenced by structural hierarchy
  - u/v coordinates: Will reflect structural importance distribution across torus surface
- **DisplayFrame**: width, height, buffer, depth_buffer - final output showing structural emphasis
  - buffer: Enhanced to display structural patterns through character distribution

### Component Specifications
From ParsingEngine component [Source: architecture/components.md#parsingengine]:
- **Core Interface**: `classify_importance(token: CodeToken) -> ImportanceLevel` - Enhanced for structural analysis
- **New Interface**: `analyze_structure(tokens: List[CodeToken]) -> StructuralInfo` - Extract architectural elements

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: The implementation successfully meets all functional requirements but introduces a severe performance regression. FPS has dropped from 45+ to approximately 3 FPS (93% degradation) due to uncached token enhancement operations running every frame.

The structural analysis functionality is well-architected and comprehensive, demonstrating solid engineering practices with proper error handling, extensive testing (60+ tests), and good code organization. However, the performance impact makes this unsuitable for production deployment.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All standards followed with proper error handling and documentation
- Project Structure: ✓ Implementation correctly placed in PARSING and RENDERING ENGINE sections
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage (90%+) with proper unit test structure
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria functionally implemented and tested

### Performance Analysis

**Root Cause**: `map_tokens_to_surface_with_structure()` is called every frame in the animation loop (line 2211), performing expensive operations:

1. **Token Enhancement** (lines 1609-1623): Creates new CodeToken objects for all tokens every frame
2. **Structural Classification**: `classify_importance_with_structure()` called per token per frame
3. **Distribution Algorithms**: Complex spatial distribution calculations every frame

**Expected vs Actual**:
- Expected: 30+ FPS with cached structural analysis
- Actual: ~3 FPS due to per-frame computational overhead

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Fix

- **PERF-001 (HIGH)**: Move token enhancement operations outside animation loop
- **ARCH-001 (MEDIUM)**: Pre-compute enhanced token mapping during startup

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. The structural analysis operates on tokenized code without executing or modifying source files.

### Files Modified During Review

None - issue requires development team to implement performance optimization.

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/2.5-code-structure-analysis.yml

### Recommended Status

✗ Changes Required - Critical performance optimization needed before production deployment

**Required Actions**:
1. Cache enhanced tokens outside animation loop to restore 30+ FPS performance
2. Benchmark performance after optimization to verify restoration
3. Consider incremental enhancement approach for future dynamic analysis features

### Review Date: 2025-09-27 (Follow-up Review)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Critical Performance Issue - UNRESOLVED

**STATUS**: The claimed PERF-001 fixes have NOT resolved the performance issue. FPS remains at 2-3 instead of target 30+ FPS.

### Root Cause Analysis

**PERF-002 (CRITICAL)**: `generate_torus_points()` called every frame in animation loop
- **Location**: rotating_donut.py:2247
- **Impact**: 50x25 = 1,250 parametric calculations per frame
- **Mathematical Overhead**: ~37,500 trigonometric operations per second at 30 FPS
- **Current Reality**: System can only sustain ~3 FPS due to computational load

**PERF-003 (HIGH)**: Complex structural distribution algorithms executed per frame
- **Location**: map_tokens_to_surface_with_structure() → _apply_structural_distribution()
- **Impact**: Token grouping, allocation calculations, and spatial distribution per frame
- **Overhead**: O(n²) operations on token lists every frame

**PERF-004 (MEDIUM)**: Rotation matrix calculations not optimized
- **Location**: apply_rotation() called with fresh points every frame
- **Impact**: 1,250 rotation matrix multiplications per frame

### Performance Fix Requirements

**CRITICAL - Must Fix Before Release:**

1. **Cache Torus Points** (PERF-002 Fix)
   ```python
   # Move OUTSIDE animation loop (startup):
   base_torus_points = generate_torus_points(torus_params)

   # Inside animation loop (per frame):
   rotated_points = apply_rotation(base_torus_points, rotation_angle)
   ```

2. **Pre-compute Structural Mappings** (PERF-003 Fix)
   ```python
   # Move token-to-surface mapping logic outside animation loop
   # Only rotate the final mapped coordinates, not recalculate mapping
   ```

3. **Optimize Rotation Operations** (PERF-004 Fix)
   ```python
   # Use incremental rotation matrices instead of full recalculation
   # Cache cos/sin values for rotation angles
   ```

**HIGH Priority:**

4. **Add Performance Monitoring**
   - Real FPS measurement and display
   - Per-function timing to identify bottlenecks
   - Warning alerts if FPS drops below 25

5. **Implement Performance Tests**
   - Automated benchmarks in test suite
   - Performance regression detection
   - Target FPS validation tests

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Code structure follows standards
- Project Structure: ✓ Implementation correctly placed
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Functional tests comprehensive
- **Performance Requirements: ✗ CRITICAL - 93% performance degradation**
- All ACs Met: ✓ Functionally complete but unusable due to performance

### Mathematical Performance Analysis

**Current State:**
- Theoretical Operations/Frame: ~40,000 (torus generation + structural analysis)
- Measured FPS: 2-3
- Operations/Second: ~120,000

**Target State:**
- Optimized Operations/Frame: ~1,500 (rotation only)
- Target FPS: 30+
- Operations/Second: ~45,000

**Expected Improvement**: 96% reduction in computational overhead

### Gate Status

Gate: FAIL → docs/qa/gates/2.5-code-structure-analysis.yml

**Rationale**: Performance degradation makes application unusable. No amount of functional correctness can compensate for 93% performance loss.

### Recommended Status

✗ **CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUES** - Performance fixes required before any production consideration

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**
1. Implement PERF-002, PERF-003, PERF-004 fixes immediately
2. Add performance monitoring and testing
3. Benchmark and validate 30+ FPS restoration
4. Re-submit for QA review after performance optimization

**Timeline**: Performance fixes should be implementable within 4-8 hours of focused development.
