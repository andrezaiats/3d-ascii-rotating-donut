## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 4.3 completion: The comprehensive error handling implementation now provides excellent foundation for documenting troubleshooting guidance. All 65 error messages include "Solution:" guidance which should be referenced in documentation. The mathematical validation, platform compatibility, and performance optimizations from Stories 4.1-4.3 provide rich material for educational documentation explaining both the "what" and the "why" of implementation decisions.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT**

Story 4.4 delivers exceptional documentation quality that transforms this technical implementation into an educational showcase piece. The documentation achieves all acceptance criteria with comprehensive inline documentation (187-line module docstring), detailed function docstrings following Google/NumPy style, and a professional 954-line README covering all aspects of the project.

The implementation demonstrates high quality with extensive mathematical explanations, performance optimization documentation, cross-platform compatibility notes, and educational examples. All documented code examples, mathematical formulas, and parameter configurations have been validated through 25 passing tests.

### Refactoring Performed

**File: tests/test_documentation.py**
- **Change**: Fixed token type strings in classification tests (lines 189, 203, 217)
- **Why**: Tests were using Python's tokenize module types ('NAME', 'OP') instead of custom types ('KEYWORD', 'OPERATOR', 'IDENTIFIER') expected by classify_importance()
- **How**: Corrected test token creation to match the tokenize_code() mapping, improving test accuracy

**File: tests/test_documentation.py**
- **Change**: Enhanced docstring test assertions (lines 408, 417-418)
- **Why**: Improved diagnostic messages for docstring validation failures
- **How**: Added function existence checks and length assertions for better test clarity

**File: performance_monitor.py**
- **Change**: Added `@functools.wraps(func)` decorator to performance_monitor wrapper (line 34)
- **Why**: Decorator was stripping docstrings from wrapped functions, causing test failures for generate_torus_points and apply_rotation
- **How**: Imported functools and applied @functools.wraps to preserve function metadata (docstring, name, annotations), following Python decorator best practices

**Impact**: All refactoring safe and beneficial:
- Fixed 5 failing tests → 25/25 tests now passing (100% pass rate)
- Improved code quality by following Python decorator best practices
- Enhanced test diagnostics for future maintenance
- Zero functional changes to application code
