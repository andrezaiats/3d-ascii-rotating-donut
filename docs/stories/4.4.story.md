## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 4.3 completion: The comprehensive error handling implementation now provides excellent foundation for documenting troubleshooting guidance. All 65 error messages include "Solution:" guidance which should be referenced in documentation. The mathematical validation, platform compatibility, and performance optimizations from Stories 4.1-4.3 provide rich material for educational documentation explaining both the "what" and the "why" of implementation decisions.

### Project Context
This story transforms the technical implementation into an educational showcase piece. The documentation must serve dual purposes:
1. **Technical Documentation**: Enable developers to understand, modify, and extend the code
2. **Educational Content**: Teach mathematical concepts (parametric surfaces, 3D transformations, perspective projection) and parsing techniques (tokenization, semantic analysis)

The single-file architecture [Source: architecture/introduction.md#starter-template-or-existing-project] requires inline documentation to be comprehensive yet concise, maintaining code readability while providing deep explanations.
