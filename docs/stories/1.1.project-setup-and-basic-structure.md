## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story insights - this is the first story in the epic.

### Data Models
The following data models need placeholder definitions [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:
- **Point3D**: Represents 3D coordinates with x, y, z, u, v attributes for torus geometry
- **Point2D**: Represents screen coordinates with x, y, depth, visible attributes
- **CodeToken**: Represents parsed source code with type, value, importance, line, column, ascii_char attributes
- **TorusParameters**: Defines torus generation with outer_radius, inner_radius, u_resolution, v_resolution, rotation_speed
- **DisplayFrame**: Represents 40x20 ASCII buffer with width, height, buffer, depth_buffer, frame_number

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- **Main file**: `rotating_donut.py` in project root (single executable file)
- **Future test files**: `tests/` directory (not created in this story)
- **Documentation**: `docs/` directory (already exists)

### Technical Constraints
From coding standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- **Python Version**: 3.8+ only, no compatibility shims required
- **Line Length**: 88 characters (Black formatter style)
- **Mathematical Precision**: Use `math.pi` and `math.tau`, never hardcoded decimals
- **Error Format**: User-facing errors must include "Solution:" with actionable guidance
- **Main Guard**: Always use `if __name__ == "__main__":` pattern
- **Type Hints**: Required for mathematical function signatures
- **ASCII Safety**: Only use basic terminal characters: . - + # (no Unicode)

### Required Imports
From tech stack [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **math**: For 3D calculations and trigonometry
- **sys**: For stdout terminal output
- **time**: For animation frame timing control
- **tokenize**: For source code analysis and parsing
- **StringIO**: From io module for tokenization support

### Function Structure Template
Based on source tree internal structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
```python
# === IMPORTS (Python Standard Library Only) ===
# === DATA MODELS ===
# === MATHEMATICAL ENGINE ===
# === PARSING ENGINE ===
# === RENDERING ENGINE ===
# === ANIMATION CONTROLLER ===
```

### Testing
**Test Location**: `tests/` directory (separate from main script) [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
**Framework**: pytest 7.4+ with built-in fixtures [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
**Coverage Requirement**: 90%+ for mathematical functions, 70%+ for rendering logic [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
**File Convention**: `test_{component_name}.py` pattern [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
**Mocking**: unittest.mock for file I/O and terminal output [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
**Test Types**: Unit tests (70%), Integration tests (20%), Visual validation (10%) [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

Note: Testing implementation will be handled in future stories - this story only creates the main file structure.

### Project Structure Notes
Current project structure aligns with architecture specification. The `rotating_donut.py` file needs to be created in the root directory as the single main executable file. The `docs/` directory already exists with architecture and PRD documentation.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-26

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent foundational implementation with clean architecture, comprehensive documentation, and proper error handling. The code demonstrates strong adherence to educational principles while maintaining professional standards. The modular structure with clear separation of concerns provides an ideal foundation for future development.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: rotating_donut.py
  - **Change**: Added constants section with TERMINAL_WIDTH, TERMINAL_HEIGHT, TARGET_FPS, and ASCII_CHARS dictionary
  - **Why**: Eliminated magic numbers throughout the codebase for better maintainability
  - **How**: Replaced hardcoded values (80, 24, 30, '#', '.') with named constants, improving code readability and configuration management

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Full compliance with all mandatory standards
- Project Structure: ✓ Perfect adherence to specified template and organization
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Appropriate test coverage for foundational story scope
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Eliminated magic numbers by introducing proper constants (rotating_donut.py)
- [x] Verified all error messages include "Solution:" format (rotating_donut.py)
- [x] Confirmed comprehensive type hints on all function signatures (rotating_donut.py)
- [ ] Consider adding automated PEP 8 linting test in future testing iterations
- [ ] Add mathematical accuracy tests when placeholder functions are implemented
- [ ] Implement integration tests for animation pipeline in subsequent stories

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Safe file operations with proper error handling, input validation for mathematical parameters, and minimal attack surface using only Python standard library.

### Performance Considerations

Appropriate performance characteristics for foundational story. Proper frame rate control and timing mechanisms in place. Memory management strategies established for future animation requirements.
