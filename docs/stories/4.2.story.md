## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 4.1 completion: Performance optimization successfully established with modular architecture (performance_monitor.py, cache_manager.py extracted). 30+ FPS target consistently achieved with >90% cache hit rates. rotating_donut.py reduced from 5,346 to 3,939 lines. The performance infrastructure provides excellent foundation for cross-platform deployment. Story 4.2 builds on this stability to ensure the optimized animation runs reliably across diverse operating systems and terminal environments.

### Data Models
Key data models for this story [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:
- **DisplayFrame**: width, height, buffer, depth_buffer, frame_number - Enhanced with dynamic sizing for terminal capability detection
  - Platform-aware dimension adjustment based on detected terminal size
  - Character set validation for terminal compatibility
- **TorusParameters**: outer_radius, inner_radius, u_resolution, v_resolution, rotation_speed - May require adjustment for performance across platforms
  - Adaptive resolution settings for lower-performance systems
  - Platform-specific performance calibration
- No structural changes required - existing data models support cross-platform enhancements

### Component Specifications
From AnimationController component [Source: architecture/components.md#animationcontroller]:
- **Enhancement Required**: `run_animation_loop()` - Add platform detection and adaptive performance handling
- **Enhancement Required**: `calculate_frame_timing()` - Ensure consistent timing across Windows/macOS/Linux
- **Enhancement Required**: `handle_interrupts()` - Validate graceful Ctrl+C handling on all platforms
- **New Function**: Platform detection and capability initialization
- **Integration**: Coordinate with existing performance monitoring from Story 4.1

From RenderingEngine component [Source: architecture/components.md#renderingengine]:
- **Enhancement Required**: `output_to_terminal()` - Implement cross-platform screen clearing and cursor control
- **New Function**: Terminal capability detection and graceful degradation logic
- **New Function**: Character set validation and fallback mechanisms
- **Integration**: Build on existing rendering infrastructure with platform-aware output

From ParsingEngine component [Source: architecture/components.md#parsingengine]:
- **Enhancement Required**: `read_self_code()` - Handle cross-platform file path differences for `__file__`
- **Path Normalization**: Use `os.path.normpath()` and `pathlib.Path` for cross-platform compatibility
- **Integration**: Maintain existing tokenization logic with platform-aware file reading

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- **Implementation Location**: `rotating_donut.py` - All platform-specific logic integrated into existing components
- **Enhanced Components**: AnimationController (platform detection, timing), RenderingEngine (terminal output), ParsingEngine (file path handling)
- **No New Files Required**: Cross-platform logic integrated within existing modular architecture
- **Documentation Location**: `README.md` - Platform compatibility section, recommended settings, troubleshooting guide

### Technology Stack
From tech stack [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **Platform Detection**: `sys.platform` (returns 'win32', 'darwin', 'linux') and `os.name` for OS identification
- **Terminal Control**: `print()` with flush for cross-platform output, ANSI escape codes for screen clearing
- **File Operations**: `__file__` with path normalization for self-code reading across platforms
- **Timing**: `time.time()` and `time.sleep()` - validate consistent behavior across platforms
- **Pure Python**: No external dependencies - maintain stdlib-only approach for maximum compatibility

### Technical Constraints
From coding standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- **Terminal Compatibility**: Use `print(..., flush=True)` for all animation output to prevent buffering issues
- **Self-Reference Safety**: Validate `__file__` exists before attempting self-code reading
- **ASCII Character Safety**: Only use characters guaranteed available in basic terminal: . - + # (no Unicode)
- **Error Message Format**: All user-facing errors must include "Solution:" with actionable guidance (platform-specific solutions)
- **Frame Rate Enforcement**: Every animation loop iteration must include timing control across all platforms

### Core Workflow Integration
Based on animation workflows [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]:
- **Application Startup**: Add platform detection and terminal capability initialization before animation begins
- **Animation Frame Generation**: Ensure consistent timing and output behavior across platforms during loop execution
- **Error Handling**: Extend existing error handling with platform-specific failure modes and recovery strategies
- **Self-Referential Token Processing**: Validate cross-platform file path handling during source code reading phase

### Cross-Platform Requirements
Building on Story 4.1 performance foundation:
- **Operating Systems**: Support Windows 10+, macOS 10.14+, Linux (major distributions with Python 3.8+)
- **Terminal Emulators**: Test on Windows Terminal, cmd.exe, PowerShell, macOS Terminal, iTerm2, gnome-terminal, xterm
- **Character Support**: Implement graceful degradation for terminals with limited ASCII character sets
- **Timing Consistency**: Maintain 30+ FPS target across platforms despite timing precision differences
- **File Path Handling**: Handle Windows backslash vs Unix forward slash in `__file__` self-reading
- **Screen Clearing**: Use ANSI escape codes where supported, fallback methods for incompatible terminals

### Testing Strategy
From testing strategy [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]:
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions matrix testing across Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 on Ubuntu, Windows, macOS
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-platform compatibility tests in `tests/test_integration.py`
- **Platform-Specific Tests**: Mock different platform environments to validate detection and handling logic
- **Terminal Capability Tests**: Simulate various terminal capabilities to test graceful degradation

### Project Structure Notes
Implementation enhances existing components within rotating_donut.py with platform-aware logic. Story 4.2 ensures the mathematical art runs reliably across diverse operating systems and terminal environments, extending the performance achievements from Story 4.1 to the broadest possible audience. Cross-platform compatibility is critical for viral sharing and educational adoption across different development environments.
