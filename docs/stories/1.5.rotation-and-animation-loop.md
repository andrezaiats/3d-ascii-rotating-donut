## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4 completion: Complete ASCII rendering system with `generate_ascii_frame()` and `output_to_terminal()` functions working perfectly. 40x20 DisplayFrame buffer established with depth sorting using painter's algorithm. ASCII character mapping working (., -, +, #) based on depth ranges. Cross-platform screen clearing implemented with ANSI codes. All integration points ready for animation system.

### Data Models
Key data models for this story [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:
- **Point3D**: x, y, z (float) coordinates with u, v parametric values - target for rotation transformation
- **TorusParameters**: rotation_speed (float) - Y-axis rotation increment per frame in radians
- **DisplayFrame**: frame_number (int) - current animation frame for debugging and timing

### Component Specifications
From AnimationController component [Source: architecture/components.md#animationcontroller]:
- **Core Interfaces**:
  - `run_animation_loop() -> None` - main execution loop with frame rate control
  - `calculate_frame_timing() -> float` - maintains target 30+ FPS performance
  - `handle_interrupts() -> bool` - graceful Ctrl+C handling and cleanup
- **Technology**: Python time module for frame timing, signal handling for interrupts
- **Dependencies**: MathematicalEngine, ParsingEngine, RenderingEngine coordination

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- **Implementation Location**: `rotating_donut.py` in project root under "=== ANIMATION CONTROLLER ===" section
- **Function Placement**: After MathematicalEngine, ParsingEngine, and RenderingEngine sections
- **Integration Point**: Coordinates with existing `apply_rotation()` function in Mathematical Engine

### Technical Constraints
From coding standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- **Mathematical Precision**: Always use `math.pi` and `math.tau`, never hardcoded decimal approximations
- **Frame Rate Enforcement**: Every animation loop iteration must include timing control - never run unbounded
- **Memory Management**: Clear display buffers after each frame - prevent memory accumulation during long runs
- **Error Message Format**: All user-facing errors must include "Solution:" with actionable guidance
- **Main Guard**: Always use `if __name__ == "__main__":` pattern for executable scripts

### Rotation Matrix Implementation
Y-axis rotation matrix mathematics [Source: architecture/components.md]:
```
rotation_matrix = [
    [cos(angle), 0, sin(angle)],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [-sin(angle), 0, cos(angle)]
]
```
Apply to Point3D: new_point = rotation_matrix * [x, y, z]

### Frame Timing Strategy
Based on animation controller requirements [Source: architecture/components.md]:
- Target frame rate: 30+ FPS (maximum 33.33ms per frame)
- Use `time.time()` for frame timing measurements
- Calculate sleep time to maintain consistent frame rate
- Handle timing variations gracefully without frame drops

### Technology Stack
From tech stack [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **Timing**: time module (stdlib) for animation frame control
- **Mathematics**: math module (stdlib) for rotation matrix calculations
- **I/O**: sys.stdout (stdlib) for terminal output coordination
- **Error Handling**: Built-in exceptions (stdlib) for graceful failure modes

### Testing
**Test Location**: `tests/test_integration.py` [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#integration-tests]
**Framework**: pytest 7.4+ with unittest.mock for timing control [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
**Coverage Requirement**: 100% for critical path (animation loop) [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#testing-philosophy]
**Test Requirements**: Frame rate validation, timing accuracy, interrupt handling, animation continuity [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#integration-tests]
**Mocking**: unittest.mock for time.time() and signal handling [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]

### Project Structure Notes
Implementation aligns with existing architecture. The `rotating_donut.py` file structure shows clear "=== ANIMATION CONTROLLER ===" section placement. Animation loop will integrate with existing MathematicalEngine `apply_rotation()`, ParsingEngine token processing, and RenderingEngine frame generation systems.
