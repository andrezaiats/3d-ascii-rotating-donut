# Story 3.2: Dynamic Character Assignment

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.1 completion: Successfully implemented precise (u,v) parametric coordinate mapping with exceptional performance (139.6 FPS average). The system now has sophisticated token-to-surface mapping with importance-weighted distribution algorithms. The 4-level importance hierarchy (CRITICAL=#, HIGH=+, MEDIUM=-, LOW=.) is fully established with proper character associations. Enhanced `map_tokens_to_surface()` provides exact parametric coordinates and spatial relationship preservation. The foundation for dynamic character assignment is complete - this story builds directly on that mapping system.

### Data Models
Key data models for this story [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:
- **CodeToken**: type, value, importance, line, column, ascii_char - The ascii_char field drives character selection
  - ascii_char: str - Associated ASCII character for rendering (CRITICAL=#, HIGH=+, MEDIUM=-, LOW=.)
  - importance: ImportanceLevel - Drives priority resolution when multiple tokens compete
  - Essential for replacing static character assignment with semantic representation
- **Point2D**: x, y, depth, visible - Screen coordinates where character assignment occurs
  - depth: float - Used for layering when multiple tokens map to same screen position
  - visible: bool - Controls character rendering based on surface visibility
- **DisplayFrame**: width, height, buffer, depth_buffer - Target for character assignment
  - buffer: List[List[str]] - 2D array populated with token-driven characters instead of static ones
  - depth_buffer: List[List[float]] - Enables priority resolution for overlapping tokens
- **Point3D**: x, y, z, u, v - Contains surface coordinates with token mapping from Story 3.1
  - Token associations established in Story 3.1 drive character selection for surface points

### Component Specifications
From RenderingEngine component [Source: architecture/components.md#renderingengine]:
- **Key Enhancement**: `generate_ascii_frame(points: List[Point2D]) -> DisplayFrame` - Enhanced for token-driven character assignment
- **Character Assignment**: Replace static characters with CodeToken.ascii_char based on token mapping
- **Priority Resolution**: Handle multiple tokens per surface area using importance hierarchy and depth sorting
- **Technology**: Pure Python with enhanced character selection algorithms integrated with existing depth sorting

From AnimationController component [Source: architecture/components.md#animationcontroller]:
- **Integration Point**: Character assignment occurs during frame generation within main animation loop
- **Performance**: Must maintain 30+ FPS target established in Story 3.1 (139.6 FPS achieved)
- **Transition Management**: Coordinate smooth character changes as rotation reveals different code sections

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- **Implementation Location**: `rotating_donut.py` in RENDERING ENGINE section
- **Function Enhancement**: Existing `generate_ascii_frame()` and character assignment logic
- **Integration Point**: Between token-to-surface mapping from Story 3.1 and DisplayFrame generation
- **Performance**: Must maintain cached operations and optimized algorithms from previous stories

### Technology Stack
From tech stack [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **Character Rendering**: sys.stdout (stdlib) for terminal output with enhanced character selection
- **Priority Resolution**: Built-in Python sorting algorithms for conflict resolution
- **Integration**: Seamless with existing tokenize module results and Point3D/Point2D pipeline
- **No External Dependencies**: Pure Python implementation within single-file constraint

### Technical Constraints
From coding standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- **ASCII Character Safety**: Only use characters guaranteed available in basic terminal: . - + # (no Unicode)
- **Performance Critical**: Must maintain cached operations - never regenerate character mappings per frame
- **Priority Resolution Safety**: Handle edge cases gracefully without breaking visual flow
- **Frame Rate Enforcement**: Maintain 30+ FPS performance achieved in Story 3.1 (139.6 FPS average)
- **Visual Stability**: Prevent flickering or jarring transitions during character assignment changes
- **Memory Management**: Efficient character assignment without duplication of existing DisplayFrame data

### Core Workflow Integration
Based on animation frame generation workflow [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#core-animation-frame-generation]:
- Enhanced `generate_ascii_frame()` called after token-to-surface mapping and before terminal output
- Character assignment occurs between depth sorting and DisplayFrame population
- Priority resolution integrates with existing depth_buffer management
- Must maintain compatibility with existing screen clearing and terminal rendering pipeline

### Performance Requirements
From Story 3.1 performance achievements:
- **Target FPS**: Maintain 30+ FPS performance (Story 3.1 achieved 139.6 FPS average)
- **Character Assignment Efficiency**: Build on existing depth sorting optimizations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Character selection must not add significant processing overhead
- **Integration**: Work with existing performance optimizations and caching systems

### Project Structure Notes
Implementation enhances existing RENDERING ENGINE section without breaking compatibility. The story builds directly on Story 3.1's precise token-to-surface mapping and performance optimizations. Dynamic character assignment represents the natural evolution from precise coordinate mapping to semantic visual representation, completing the code-driven visualization pipeline.

**Framework**: pytest 7.4+ with unittest.mock for controlled character testing [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
**Coverage Requirement**: 90%+ for all character assignment functions [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#testing-philosophy]
**Test Requirements**: Token-driven character assignment validation, importance hierarchy enforcement, priority resolution verification, visual transition quality, character density scaling [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
