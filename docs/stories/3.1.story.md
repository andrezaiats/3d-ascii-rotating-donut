## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** code tokens mapped to specific torus surface coordinates,
**so that** source code structure directly drives the visual pattern on the rotating donut.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.5 completion: Successfully implemented comprehensive structural analysis with exceptional performance (139.6 FPS average). The system now has enhance_tokens_with_structure(), cached torus generation, and pre-computed structural mappings. Token classification system with 4-level importance hierarchy (CRITICAL=#, HIGH=+, MEDIUM=-, LOW=.) is fully operational. The existing map_tokens_to_surface_with_structure() provides the foundation for precise coordinate mapping but currently uses approximated distribution - this story will enhance it with exact parametric coordinates.

### Data Models
Key data models for this story [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:
- **Point3D**: x, y, z, u, v - Contains parametric u,v coordinates (0-2π) that will be directly mapped to tokens
  - u: float - Parametric u coordinate on torus surface (major circumference)
  - v: float - Parametric v coordinate on torus surface (minor circumference)
  - Essential for precise token-to-surface coordinate mapping
- **CodeToken**: type, value, importance, line, column, ascii_char - Will be enhanced with exact surface coordinates
  - importance: ImportanceLevel - Used for weighted distribution priority
  - Drives character selection and surface allocation density
- **TorusParameters**: outer_radius, inner_radius, u_resolution, v_resolution, rotation_speed - Defines surface geometry
  - u_resolution/v_resolution: Control surface point density for token distribution
  - Used to calculate valid parametric coordinate ranges
- **DisplayFrame**: width, height, buffer, depth_buffer - Final visual output with token-driven characters
  - Integration point where precise coordinate mapping becomes visible

### Component Specifications
From RenderingEngine component [Source: architecture/components.md#renderingengine]:
- **Enhanced Interface**: `map_tokens_to_surface(tokens: List[CodeToken], points: List[Point3D]) -> None` - Will be enhanced for precise (u,v) coordinate mapping
- **Key Enhancement**: Replace approximate distribution with exact parametric coordinate calculation
- **Technology**: Pure Python with enhanced distribution algorithms for precise coordinate control
- **Integration**: Must work with existing depth sorting and ASCII frame generation

From MathematicalEngine component [Source: architecture/components.md#mathematicalengine]:
- **Core Interface**: `generate_torus_points(params: TorusParameters) -> List[Point3D]` - Provides Point3D with u,v coordinates
- **Technology**: Uses parametric torus equations with math.sin, math.cos for precise geometry
- **Dependency**: Existing torus generation provides the u,v coordinate foundation for token mapping

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- **Implementation Location**: `rotating_donut.py` in RENDERING ENGINE section
- **Function Enhancement**: Existing `map_tokens_to_surface()` and related functions
- **Integration Point**: Between existing token classification and surface point generation
- **Performance**: Must maintain cached operations and 30+ FPS performance from Story 2.5

### Technology Stack
From tech stack [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **Mathematics**: math module (stdlib) for parametric coordinate calculations
- **Performance**: Built-in Python optimizations for coordinate mapping algorithms
- **Integration**: Seamless with existing tokenize module and sys.stdout rendering
- **No External Dependencies**: Pure Python implementation within single-file constraint

### Technical Constraints
From coding standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- **Mathematical Precision**: Use math.pi and math.tau for parametric calculations, never hardcoded decimals
- **Performance Critical**: Must maintain cached operations - never regenerate identical mappings per frame
- **Token Classification Safety**: Unknown or edge-case tokens must default to existing importance levels
- **Mathematical Validation**: All (u,v) coordinates must be validated (0 ≤ u,v ≤ 2π)
- **Frame Rate Enforcement**: Maintain 30+ FPS performance achieved in Story 2.5
- **Memory Management**: Efficient coordinate storage without duplication of existing Point3D data

### Core Workflow Integration
Based on animation frame generation workflow [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#core-animation-frame-generation]:
- Enhanced map_tokens_to_surface() called during frame generation with precise coordinate mapping
- Token distribution occurs after torus point generation and before ASCII character assignment
- Precise (u,v) mapping integrates with existing rotation and projection pipeline
- Must maintain compatibility with existing depth sorting and display frame generation

### Performance Requirements
From Story 2.5 performance achievements:
- **Target FPS**: Maintain 30+ FPS performance (Story 2.5 achieved 139.6 FPS average)
- **Cached Operations**: Build on existing cached torus generation and pre-computed structural mappings
- **Memory Efficiency**: Coordinate mapping must not add significant memory overhead
- **Integration**: Work with existing performance optimizations (PERF-002, PERF-003 fixes)

### Project Structure Notes
Implementation enhances existing RENDERING ENGINE section without breaking compatibility. The story builds directly on Story 2.5's performance optimizations and structural analysis capabilities. Token-to-surface coordinate mapping represents the natural evolution from approximate distribution to precise geometric control, enabling higher-fidelity code visualization.
