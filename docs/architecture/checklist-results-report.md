## Risk Assessment

**Top 5 Risks by Severity:**

1. **MEDIUM - Performance Degradation Risk**
   - Real-time 30+ FPS requirement not quantified with specific CPU/memory targets
   - **Mitigation:** Define performance benchmarks and fallback mechanisms

2. **MEDIUM - Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - Terminal behavior variations across Windows/macOS/Linux not fully addressed
   - **Mitigation:** Expand testing matrix and compatibility documentation

3. **LOW - File Operation Failures**
   - Self-code reading lacks robust retry mechanisms for network filesystems
   - **Mitigation:** Add retry logic and enhanced error recovery

4. **LOW - Mathematical Edge Cases**
   - Extreme parameter values could cause numerical instability
   - **Mitigation:** Enhanced input validation and bounds checking

5. **LOW - Memory Accumulation**
   - Long-running animations could accumulate memory without explicit cleanup
   - **Mitigation:** Implement periodic memory cleanup cycles

## Recommendations
