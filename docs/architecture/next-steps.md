# Next Steps

After completing the architecture:

1. **No Frontend Architecture Needed:**
   - This is a terminal-based application with no traditional UI components
   - ASCII rendering is integrated into the core architecture

2. **For Implementation:**
   - Review with Product Owner for approval
   - Begin story implementation with Dev agent using this architecture as the blueprint
   - Follow the defined coding standards and component structure

3. **Development Readiness:**
   - Use the source tree structure for project organization
   - Implement mathematical engine first for core 3D functionality
   - Add parsing engine for self-referential capabilities
   - Integrate rendering engine for ASCII visualization
   - Complete with animation controller for smooth operation

**Implementation Priority:**
1. Mathematical foundation (torus generation, rotation, projection)
2. Basic ASCII rendering and terminal output
3. Self-code reading and token parsing
4. Integration of code-driven visualization
5. Performance optimization and cross-platform testing
