# REST API Spec

**REST API: Not Applicable**

This project does not include any REST API functionality. The application operates entirely through:
- Direct Python script execution
- Terminal-based ASCII output
- Self-contained operation with no network services

The viral sharing and educational goals are achieved through code sharing rather than API endpoints.
