# External APIs

**External APIs: None Required**

This project intentionally avoids all external API integrations to maintain:
- Maximum portability and viral shareability
- Zero-dependency execution
- Educational transparency
- Cross-platform compatibility

The self-referential nature means the "data source" is the script's own code, eliminating any need for external services, APIs, or network connectivity.
