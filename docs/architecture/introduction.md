# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for **3D ASCII Rotating Donut with Self-Code Display**, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
This project is entirely terminal-based with no traditional UI components. The "frontend" is the ASCII terminal display, which is integrated directly into the core application architecture rather than requiring a separate frontend architecture document.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on your PRD requirements for a single Python file with zero external dependencies, this is a **greenfield project built from scratch**. No starter template will be used to maintain maximum simplicity and educational value.

**Rationale:** Using a starter template would introduce unnecessary complexity and dependencies that conflict with the core requirement of being a single, self-contained Python file. The educational and viral sharing goals are best served by a clean, from-scratch implementation that showcases pure Python capabilities.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Single Python file structure for maximum shareability
- Pure Python standard library only (no external dependencies)
- Self-contained architecture with no external services
- Cross-platform terminal compatibility as primary constraint
