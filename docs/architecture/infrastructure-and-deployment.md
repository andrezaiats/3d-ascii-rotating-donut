# Infrastructure and Deployment

## Infrastructure as Code
- **Tool:** Not applicable
- **Location:** Not applicable
- **Approach:** No infrastructure required - direct Python execution on user machines

## Deployment Strategy
- **Strategy:** Direct script sharing and execution
- **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions (for testing and release automation)
- **Pipeline Configuration:** `.github/workflows/test.yml` for automated testing across Python versions

## Environments

- **Development:** Local Python 3.8+ with testing framework
- **Testing:** GitHub Actions matrix testing (Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11) across (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
- **Production:** End-user local execution - no server infrastructure required
- **Sharing:** Git repository hosting (GitHub) with releases for version management

## Environment Promotion Flow

```
Developer Machine → Git Commit → GitHub Repository → Automated Testing → Release Tag → User Download/Clone → Direct Execution
```

**Distribution Channels:**
1. **GitHub Repository** - Primary distribution with README, documentation, and releases
2. **Social Media Sharing** - Direct file sharing for immediate execution
3. **Educational Platforms** - Integration into coding tutorials and mathematical visualization courses
4. **Community Forums** - Reddit, Stack Overflow, creative coding communities

## Rollback Strategy
- **Primary Method:** Git version control with tagged releases
- **Trigger Conditions:** Critical bugs affecting cross-platform compatibility or mathematical accuracy
- **Recovery Time Objective:** Immediate (users can revert to previous working version instantly)
