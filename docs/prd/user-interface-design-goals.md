# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The user experience should be immediate and mesmerizing - a single command execution that transforms into a continuously rotating mathematical artwork. The interface is purely visual through terminal display, requiring no user interaction beyond starting the script. The experience should evoke contemplation and appreciation for the intersection of mathematics, programming, and art.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Zero-interaction execution** - Run script and immediately see results
- **Contemplative viewing** - Designed for extended observation and appreciation
- **Educational exploration** - Code serves as learning material for mathematical concepts
- **Social sharing** - Visual output optimized for screenshots and demonstrations

## Core Screens and Views
- **Single rotating donut display** - The primary and only user interface
- **Terminal output window** - 40x20 character ASCII rendering space
- **Startup message** (optional) - Brief explanation of what user is viewing

## Accessibility: None
This is a visual art piece focused on ASCII terminal output. Accessibility considerations are limited by the fundamental nature of the visual mathematical art concept.

## Branding
Mathematical elegance meets programming artistry - clean, minimal aesthetic that emphasizes the beauty of code and mathematics. No corporate branding required; the code itself serves as the artistic statement.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Cross-platform terminal compatibility targeting any system with Python 3.6+ and basic ASCII terminal support, including Windows Command Prompt, macOS Terminal, and Linux terminal emulators.
