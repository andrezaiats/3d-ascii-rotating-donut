# Epic 1: Foundation & Mathematical Core

**Epic Goal:** Establish project infrastructure and implement core 3D torus mathematics with basic ASCII rendering capability, delivering a working rotating donut that validates the mathematical approach and visual concept.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Basic Structure
**As a developer,**
**I want a well-organized Python file with clear module structure,**
**so that the codebase is maintainable and educational.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Single Python file created with clear function organization and imports
2. File includes comprehensive header documentation explaining the project concept
3. Basic project structure includes placeholders for math, rendering, and main loop functions
4. Code follows PEP 8 style guidelines for educational readability
5. File can be executed without errors (even if minimal functionality)

## Story 1.2: 3D Torus Mathematical Foundation
**As a developer,**
**I want accurate 3D torus geometry generation,**
**so that the visual foundation supports realistic donut shape rendering.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Implement parametric torus equations with configurable inner radius (r) and outer radius (R)
2. Generate 3D points (x, y, z) across torus surface with proper mathematical precision
3. Support configurable resolution for surface point density
4. Include mathematical documentation explaining torus equations in code comments
5. Validate mathematical accuracy with known torus properties (volume, surface area)

## Story 1.3: 3D Projection and Depth Sorting
**As a developer,**
**I want 3D points projected to 2D screen coordinates with proper depth handling,**
**so that the donut appears three-dimensional in ASCII output.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Implement perspective projection from 3D coordinates to 2D screen space
2. Map projected coordinates to 40x20 ASCII character grid
3. Calculate Z-depth for each surface point to enable proper depth sorting
4. Handle edge cases where points project outside the display area
5. Maintain mathematical precision to prevent visual artifacts

## Story 1.4: Basic ASCII Rendering Engine
**As a developer,**
**I want a clean ASCII character output system,**
**so that 3D geometry can be visualized in terminal display.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Create 40x20 character buffer for frame rendering
2. Implement depth sorting to render closest points last (painter's algorithm)
3. Use basic ASCII characters (., -, +, #) to represent different depth/brightness levels
4. Clear screen and render new frame for smooth animation
5. Handle terminal compatibility for character output

## Story 1.5: Rotation and Animation Loop
**As a developer,**
**I want smooth Y-axis rotation with configurable speed,**
**so that the donut continuously rotates creating animated visual effect.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Implement Y-axis rotation matrix transformation for 3D points
2. Create main animation loop with configurable frame rate control
3. Apply rotation incrementally each frame to create smooth motion
4. Maintain consistent timing across different system performance levels
5. Support graceful exit with keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C)
