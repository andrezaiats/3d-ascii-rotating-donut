# Epic List

## Epic 1: Foundation & Mathematical Core
**Goal:** Establish project infrastructure and implement core 3D torus mathematics with basic ASCII rendering capability.

## Epic 2: Self-Referential Code Analysis
**Goal:** Implement tokenization system that reads and parses the script's own source code, creating semantic importance hierarchy.

## Epic 3: Dynamic Visualization Engine
**Goal:** Integrate code parsing with 3D rendering to create the rotating donut display where code tokens drive visual representation.

## Epic 4: Performance & Polish
**Goal:** Optimize animation performance, enhance visual quality, and ensure cross-platform compatibility for production release.
