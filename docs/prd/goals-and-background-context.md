# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Create a viral, shareable piece of creative code that generates 1000+ GitHub stars within 6 months
- Establish reputation for innovative creative coding projects combining math, art, and programming
- Generate substantial social media engagement (500+ shares/mentions within 3 months)
- Serve as portfolio centerpiece demonstrating mathematical and parsing skills
- Provide educational value for understanding 3D mathematics and code tokenization
- Create a self-referential artwork that transforms source code into mathematical visualization

## Background Context

This project addresses a gap in code visualization tools that are typically static, disconnected from runtime experience, and fail to create engaging artistic representations of code structure. Current solutions like IDE syntax highlighting or separate diagramming tools miss opportunities for enhanced code comprehension through visual metaphors and creative expression.

The solution leverages Python's self-referential capabilities and mathematical beauty to create a script that reads its own source code, parses it semantically, and renders it as a continuously rotating 3D ASCII donut. Different code elements (keywords, variables, operators, comments) are represented by ASCII characters based on their semantic importance, creating a meditative, artistic visualization that serves both educational and aesthetic purposes.
