# Epic 3: Dynamic Visualization Engine

**Epic Goal:** Integrate code parsing with 3D rendering to create the rotating donut display where code tokens drive visual representation, delivering the complete product vision of self-referential mathematical art.

## Story 3.1: Token-Surface Integration
**As a developer,**
**I want code tokens mapped to specific torus surface coordinates,**
**so that source code structure directly drives the visual pattern on the rotating donut.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Map each token to specific (u,v) parametric coordinates on torus surface
2. Distribute tokens based on importance weighting and sequential order
3. Handle variable source code lengths by scaling distribution algorithms
4. Ensure tokens maintain spatial relationships that reflect code structure
5. Provide consistent mapping that produces recognizable patterns across rotations

## Story 3.2: Dynamic Character Assignment
**As a developer,**
**I want torus surface points to display ASCII characters based on underlying tokens,**
**so that code semantics are visually represented in the rotating display.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Replace static ASCII characters with token-driven character selection
2. Apply importance hierarchy (Critical=#, High=+, Medium=-, Low=.) to surface rendering
3. Handle multiple tokens mapping to same surface area through priority resolution
4. Maintain smooth visual transitions as rotation reveals different code sections
5. Ensure character density reflects code complexity and token distribution

## Story 3.3: Rotation-Aware Code Display
**As a developer,**
**I want code token visibility to change realistically as the donut rotates,**
**so that different parts of the source code become visible based on 3D orientation.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Calculate token visibility based on 3D rotation and surface normal orientation
2. Hide tokens on back-facing surfaces or apply appropriate depth-based dimming
3. Smoothly transition token visibility as surface orientation changes during rotation
4. Maintain consistent visual quality across all rotation angles
5. Handle edge cases where token boundaries align with surface visibility boundaries

## Story 3.4: Real-Time Integration Pipeline
**As a developer,**
**I want seamless real-time integration between code analysis and 3D rendering,**
**so that the complete visualization performs smoothly during continuous rotation.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Integrate token parsing pipeline with 3D rendering loop efficiently
2. Cache parsed token data to avoid re-parsing on every frame
3. Update surface character assignments based on current rotation angle
4. Maintain target frame rate (30+ FPS) with complete code-driven rendering
5. Handle memory management to prevent performance degradation over time

## Story 3.5: Visual Harmony and Aesthetics
**As a developer,**
**I want balanced visual composition that creates engaging artistic effect,**
**so that the result is both technically impressive and aesthetically pleasing.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Balance token density to avoid visual clutter while maintaining code representation
2. Ensure smooth visual flow as different code sections rotate into view
3. Apply appropriate spacing and clustering to create recognizable patterns
4. Handle visual edge cases like very dense or very sparse code sections
5. Validate that the complete visualization achieves the intended artistic impact
